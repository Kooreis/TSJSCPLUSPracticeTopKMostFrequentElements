# Question: How do you find the top K most frequent elements in an array? JavaScript Summary

The JavaScript code provided is a solution to find the top K most frequent elements in an array. It first creates a frequency map using a hash map to count the occurrence of each element in the array. Then, it uses a priority queue, implemented as a binary heap, to keep track of the top K frequent elements. The priority queue is designed such that the element with the highest frequency is always at the top. If the size of the priority queue exceeds K, the element with the lowest frequency is removed to maintain the size of the queue. This ensures that only the top K frequent elements are kept in the queue. Finally, the elements in the priority queue are popped out and pushed into an array, which is then returned as the result. This array contains the top K most frequent elements from the original array.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript version of the solution is similar to the JavaScript version in terms of the overall approach to solving the problem. Both versions use a hash map (or a Map in TypeScript) to count the frequency of each element in the array, and a heap data structure to keep track of the top K frequent elements. 

However, there are some differences in the implementation details and language features used:

1. TypeScript uses static types: In the TypeScript version, types are specified for function parameters, return values, and class properties. This can help catch potential type-related errors at compile time and make the code easier to understand and maintain.

2. Different heap implementation: The JavaScript version uses a PriorityQueue class, while the TypeScript version uses a MaxHeap class. The functionality is similar, but the method names and implementation details are slightly different. For example, the TypeScript version uses bitwise shift operators for calculating parent and child indices in the heap.

3. Different way of handling optional values: In the TypeScript version, the `Map.get` method can potentially return `undefined` if the key is not in the map. To handle this, the TypeScript version uses the non-null assertion operator (`!`) to assert that the value is not `undefined`. In contrast, the JavaScript version uses the logical OR operator (`||`) to provide a default value of 0 when the key is not in the map.

4. Different way of popping elements from the heap: In the JavaScript version, elements are popped from the heap and added to the result array in a while loop until the heap is empty. In the TypeScript version, elements are popped from the heap in a for loop that runs exactly K times. This means that the TypeScript version assumes that there are at least K elements in the heap, while the JavaScript version does not make this assumption.

# C++ Differences

The C++ version of the solution follows a similar approach to the JavaScript version. It first counts the frequency of each element in the array using an unordered_map (which is similar to a JavaScript Map). Then it uses a priority queue to keep track of the top K frequent elements. The priority queue is implemented using the STL priority_queue, which is a max heap by default, with the element of highest frequency at the top. When the size of the priority queue exceeds K, the element of lowest frequency is removed. Finally, the top K frequent elements are returned in a vector.

The main differences between the two versions are due to the differences in the languages themselves:

1. Syntax: C++ has a different syntax compared to JavaScript. For example, C++ uses "vector<int>" instead of an array, and "unordered_map<int, int>" instead of a Map.

2. Standard Library: C++ uses the STL priority_queue for the priority queue implementation, while the JavaScript version implements a custom priority queue.

3. Type Safety: C++ is a statically typed language, so the types of all variables must be declared upfront. JavaScript is dynamically typed, so variables can hold values of any type.

4. Memory Management: In C++, the programmer has direct control over memory management. In JavaScript, memory management is handled automatically by the garbage collector.

5. Iteration: In C++, the "for" loop is used to iterate over the elements in the array and the unordered_map. In JavaScript, the "forEach" method is used to iterate over the elements in the array and the Map.

6. Function Definition: In C++, the function is defined outside of the main function and then called within the main function. In JavaScript, the function is defined and then immediately called.
